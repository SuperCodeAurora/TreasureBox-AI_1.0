**A hyper-lightweight, 3-tier multi-agent Citadel that runs a 28-node AI enterprise in your terminal. Zero bloat. Pure logic.**

Treasure Box AI is a highly modular Multi-Agent System (MAS). It abandons the bloated, monolithic designs of traditional AI frameworks. Instead, it uses a **3-Tier Enterprise Architecture** to break down massive tasks, managed by an orchestrator, executed by department heads, and built by junior sub-agents.

### ⚡ Why Treasure Box AI?

| Feature | The Bloated Giants | 📦 Treasure Box AI |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Storage Footprint** | 5.2 GB+ | **< 25 MB** |
| **Hierarchy** | Flat / Black-box routing | **Strict 3-Tier Corporate DAG** |
| **Quality Control** | Infinite feedback loops | **Dynamic "Firing" Protocol** |

## 🏛️ The 3-Tier Enterprise Architecture



The Citadel operates on a strict corporate hierarchy to prevent AI hallucinations and context-window collapse. 

1. **Tier 1 (The Orchestrator):** Routes the user's master prompt to the correct departments.
2. **Tier 2 (Department Heads):** Middle management. They break tasks down and manage the laborers. **The Firing Protocol:** Heads have absolute authority to dynamically "fire" (bypass) underperforming helpers during a runtime and complete the task themselves to ensure the project doesn't fail.
3. **Tier 3 (Junior Helpers):** Narrowly scoped sub-agents who do the manual labor.

  * *Helper 2 (Junior Logic Mapper):* Maps out database schemas and state-machine flows.
* **Head of Recon (The Searcher):** Hooked into the live internet to pull real-time data and documentation.
  * *Helper 1 (Junior Web Scraper):* Executes raw search queries and pulls HTML data.
  * *Helper 2 (Junior API Fetcher):* Looks for structured JSON data and open API endpoints.
* **Head of Data (The Quant):** Handles statistical analysis, probabilities, and complex math.
  * *Helper 1 (Junior Statistician):* Runs standard deviations, probabilities, and math checks.
  * *Helper 2 (Junior Data Cleanser):* Formats messy data into clean arrays and tables.

### 💻 TIER 2 & 3: THE ENGINEERING WING
* **Head of Engineering (The Developer):** Oversees all code generation based on the Architect's blueprint.
  * *Helper 1 (Junior Frontend Coder):* Writes the UI code (HTML/CSS/React/JS).

### 🛡️ TIER 2 & 3: THE QUALITY & SECURITY WING
* **Head of QA (The Solver):** Tries to break the Engineering team's code. Demands bug fixes.
  * *Helper 1 (Junior Unit Tester):* Writes automated test scripts for the code.
  * *Helper 2 (Junior Edge-Case Checker):* Brainstorms weird user inputs that might crash the app.
* **Head of Offensive Security (The Red Teamer):** Attacks the code to find vulnerabilities.
  * *Helper 1 (Junior Penetration Tester):* Simulates live attacks on the proposed logic.
  * *Helper 2 (Junior Static Analyzer):* Scans the code text for hardcoded secrets or memory leaks.
* **Head of Compliance (The Lawyer):** Audits the final output for copyright and legal risks.
  * *Helper 1 (Junior Copyright Auditor):* Checks if the scraped data violates licenses.
